Tokenization: Breaking up the text into units of meaning, called tokens.

Corpus: A clean, sample of text called a corpus file. Using Methods such as removing whitespaces,  numbers, UTR, punctuation and so on.

Language Models: Assign probabilities to sequences of tokens based on previous word histories, & consecutive sequences of tokens

Katz Back-Off Model: (type of probabilistic language model)  is a generative n-gram language model that estimates the conditional probability of a word given itâ€™s history in the n-gram
